# README for developers

We use _Visual Studio Code_ (VSC) for this project. It is highly recommended, that you use it as well.
Of course you can use another IDE, if you want to, but please stick to the formatting settings defined by .editorconfig and omnisharp.json.

## VSC Extensions

In this section I will list some must-have and some recommended extensions.

### Must-Have Extensions

-   C# (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp>)  
    Adds basic C# functionality + formatting to VSC. Programming without it seems senseless.
-   EditorConfig for VS Code (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig>)  
    Enables support for cross-IDE settings with .editorconfig.

### Recommended Extensions

-   Better Comments (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments>)  
    Colors different kinds of comments in other colors (e.g. TODO or Alerts)
-   Bracket Pair Colorizer (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer>)  
    Colors matching brackets with the same color to easier see, which brackets belong together
-   C# XML Documentation Comments (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.docomment>)  
    Simplifies documenting in C#, because it generates a basic template, when entering `///`
-   Git Lens (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens>)
    Offers information about git changes, blame etc. as lens
-   gitflow (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.gitflow>)  
    Simplifies using the gitflow workflow for repository organisation

### Themes

-   Material Icon Theme (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme>)  
    Offers different Icons for files and folders in material design
